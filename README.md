# About 
A simple desktop application with a GUI that allows users to send HTTP requests to APIs, similar to Postman. This app supports various request methods and now it supports only JSON format but I will add other formats in the future, also allows you to manage and save requests for easy reuse.
This tool will act as Postman API without a need to log in 

# Features
- Send HTTP requests: GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, PATCH.
- Save Requests: Save your commonly used requests for easy access.
- Response Handling: View formatted responses, with JSON pretty-printing and error handling.
- Cross-Platform: Built as a desktop application accessible on all major platforms (Windows, Mac, Linux).
- Customizable Environment: Support for multiple API environments (development, staging, production).
